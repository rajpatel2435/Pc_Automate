# Pc_Automate


Our project is PC Automate. This site is based on a useful idea in a way in which users will be able to find and 
buy a customized computer of their choices much easier as compared to other tools on the internet, even though numerous websites help users
to get customized machines of their choices but after analysing we found that they hardly upload or add new products. This is not the case on 
our site. On this website, we have 3 modules. The first module contains the admin module, the second module contains the builder’s module that 
will be responsible to customize the parts and finally the third module contains the user's point of view. Who will log in as a client and will 
be able to find the products of their needs?
Building your PC and need thoughts on where to get everything rolling? Investigate our construct guides which cover a variety of system products
and are in your budget. We also provide desktops that are completely customized by our skilled engineers according to the user's needs. Here are the 
key features of the website:


•	Wide varieties of computer parts available on the website
•	Make your PC templates and share them with your friends.
•	A shop for Headphones, Keyboards etc…
•	Build guides available(suggestions about the latest technology and part available in the market)
